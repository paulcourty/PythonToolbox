# Python Toolbox

<br>

Personal Python Toolbox of code elements & blocks that I use often.

I created this Toolbox after going back & forth between Stack Overflow and Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc. I'm now updating it along the way !

<br>

I also added the Cheat Sheets that I use the most, it's super practical on a daily basis:

- Git
- Anaconda
- Pandas
- [Stanford ML](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-229/cheatsheet-machine-learning-tips-and-tricks)
